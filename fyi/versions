      Loosen the restrictions around directly assignable expressions
      
      We currently only allow a subset of expressions to be used as the target
      of assignment. The Swift compiler also only allows a subset, but keeping
      track of their subset is hard. For example, in #321 we see that an
      optional expression can be used for assignment but we don't currently
      support that.
      
      Let's get out of that game. All expressions can be assignments now!
      Sure, that doesn't work for the real swift compiler, but that's not our
      circus, and furthermore, not our monkeys.
